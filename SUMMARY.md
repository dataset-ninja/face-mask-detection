**Face Mask Detection** is a dataset for an object detection task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the safety and surveillance industries. 

The dataset consists of 853 images with 4072 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *with_mask*, *without_mask*, and *mask_weared_incorrect*.

Images in the Face Mask Detection dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2020.
